# Portfolio Optimization

## Problem Statement:
Construct a portfolio of 100K USD with 90% equities and 10% cash. Will construct portfolio of based on the following methods:

* Equal Weightage Portfolio.
* Using Machine Learning techniques based on Bottom Up Optimization.
* Efficient Frontier.
* We will build intraday trading stratrgies to maximize profit. We will create the Sharpe Ratio of portfolio to assess statistics.

## Data
* We will be using 5 minutes data over the period of 2018, beginning 01st May, 2018 till 07th October, 2018. We have choosen 05 stocks named as Company 01 to 05. The price information is avialble at an interval of 05 minutes.Though at this point, weâ€™re unsure as to exactly which stocks we will be trading, we will find the solution using Bottom Up Optimization.
* We will use data from 01st May, 2018 - 31st August, 2018 to training our model, and use the remaining period 01st September -07th October, 2018 as test period.
